# NestJS starter template

## Introduction

This template is based upon [nestjs-angular-starter](https://github.com/shy2net/nestjs-angular-starter) and contains the same code but without the Angular part.

Head over the repository to see the full specs of what this template is capable of.

In short this template comes with the following technologies:

- NodeJS express typescript (with SSL support) based on NestJS - for easier express setup using decorators
- Mocha\Chai for backend testing + API tests
- Environment based configurations
- Mongoose (with basic user model)
- Logging (using NestJS Logger)
- JWT and token authentication built-in (including user roles)
- Social Authentication (Google and Facebook)
- Form validations using (class-validator)
- Docker support based on alpine and node 12

Please read the README.md of the original [nestjs-angular-starter](https://github.com/shy2net/nestjs-angular-starter) as it is the same (with no Angular), for more instructions.
